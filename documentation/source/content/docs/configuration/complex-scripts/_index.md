## **More complex scripts**

If you want to execute more complex scripts it might be helpful to store them outside of the extension and create the final output there. 

[Here](https://github.com/raujonas/executor/issues/31#issue-902528380) is a very good example of how you can achieve this. With this solution it is also possible to create a rotating output of multiple different commands.
